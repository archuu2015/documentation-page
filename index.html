                        The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that
                        directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.

                        C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known
                        as mother language.

                <code>
                    int main(){    
                    printf("Hello C Language");

                A variable is a name of the memory location. It is used to store data.
                Its value can be changed, and it can be reused many times.


            </p>
            <p>
                It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily identified.

            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
                <p> The if-else statement in C is used to perform the operations based on some specific condition.
                    The operations specified in if block are executed if and only if the given condition is true.</p>
                <p>There are the following variants of if statement in C language.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If statement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If-else statement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If else-if ladder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nested if
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The if-else statement is used to perform two operations for a single condition.
                    The if-else statement is an extension to the if statement using which, we can perform two different
                    operations,
                    i.e., one is for the correctness of that condition, and the other is for the incorrectness of the
                    condition.
                    Here, we must notice that if and else block cannot be executed simiulteneously.
                    Using if-else statement is always preferable since it always invokes an otherwise case with every if
                    condition.
                    The syntax of the if-else statement is given below.</p>
                <code>if(expression){  
                    //code to be executed if condition is true  
                    }else{  
                    //code to be executed if condition is false  
                    }  </code>

                <p>
                    Let's see the simple example to check whether a number is even or odd using if-else statement in C
                    language.
                </p>
                <code>int main(){    
                    int number=0;    
                    printf("enter a number:");    
                    scanf("%d",&number);     
                    if(number%2==0){    
                    printf("%d is even number",number);    
                    }    
                    else{    
                    printf("%d is odd number",number);    
                    }     
                    return 0;  
                    }    
          </code>
                <p>Output:</p>

                <code>enter a number:4
                    4 is even number
                    enter a number:5
                    5 is odd number</code>

            <article>
                <p>In c, we can divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as function.
                    The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}.
                    A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.
                    In other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program.
                    The function is also known as procedureor subroutinein other programming languages.</p>

            <header>Function Aspects</header>
            <article>
                <p>There are three aspects of a C function.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Function declaration:</b> A function must be
                        declared globally in a c program to tell the compiler about the function name, function
                        parameters, and return type.</li>
                    <p>Syntax:</p><code>return_type function_name (argument list);</code>
                    <li>
                        <b>Function call:</b> Function can be called from anywhere in the program. The parameter list
                        must not differ in function calling and function declaration.
                        We must pass the same number of functions as it is declared in the function declaration.
                    </li>
                    <p>Syntax:</p><code>function_name (argument_list)</code>
                    <li>
                        <b>Function definition:</b> It contains the actual statements which are to be executed. It is
                        the most important aspect to which the control comes when the function is called.
                        Here, we must notice that only one value can be returned from the function.
                    </li>
                    <p>Syntax:</p><code>return_type function_name (argument list) {function body;}</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Array">
            <header>Array</header>
            <article>
                <p>An array is defined as the collection of similar type of data items stored at contiguous memory
                    locations.
                    Arrays are the derived data type in C programming language which can store the primitive type of
                    data such as int,
                    char, double, float, etc. It also has the capability to store the collection of derived data types,
                    such as pointers,
                    structure, etc.
                    The array is the simplest data structure where each data element can be randomly accessed by using
                    its index number.</p>
                <p>C array is beneficial if you have to store similar elements. For example, if we want to store the
                    marks of a student in
                    6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variables for the marks in the different subject.
                    Instead of that, we can define an array which can store the marks in each subject at the contiguous
                    memory locations.</p>

                <p>The simplest way to initialize an array is by using the index of each element.
                    We can initialize each element of the array by using the index.
                    Consider the following example.</p>
